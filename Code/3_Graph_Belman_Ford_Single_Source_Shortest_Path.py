# GRAPH ALGORITHM - DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

# Q: How's Belman Ford algo different from Dijkstra?
# A: Both algorithms compute the shortest path from a single source, however,
#    Dijkstra doesn't work when there's a negative edge edge.
#    Belman Fod works for such cases and it's simpler.
#    On the other hand, when you compute the time complexity, Dijkstra is O(VlogV) but Belman Ford is O(VE).

# Q: What are other differences between Dijkstra and Belman-Ford?
# A: 
# Class to represent a graph
class Graph:

    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.V = vertices # No. of vertices
        self.graph = []

    # function to add an edge to graph
    def addEdge(self, u, v, w):
        self.graph.append([u, v, w])

    # utility function used to print the solution
    def printArr(self, dist):
        print("Vertex Distance from Source")
        for i in range(self.V):
            print("{0}\t\t{1}".format(i, dist[i]))

    # The main function that finds shortest distances from src to
    # all other vertices using Bellman-Ford algorithm. The function
    # also detects negative weight cycle

        # Step 1: Initialize distances from src to all other vertices
        # as INFINITE
        dist = [float("Inf")] * self.V
        dist[src] = 0


        # Step 2: Relax all edges |V| - 1 times. A simple shortest
        # path from src to any other vertex can have at-most |V| - 1
        # edges
        for _ in range(self.V - 1):
            # Update dist value and parent index of the adjacent vertices of
            # the picked vertex. Consider only those vertices which are still in
            # queue
            for u, v, w in self.graph:
                if dist[u] != float("Inf") and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                        dist[v] = dist[u] + w

        # Step 3: check for negative-weight cycles. The above step
        # guarantees shortest distances if graph doesn't contain
        # negative weight cycle. If we get a shorter path, then there
        # is a cycle.

        for u, v, w in self.graph:
                if dist[u] != float("Inf") and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                        print("Graph contains negative weight cycle")
                        return

        # print all distance
